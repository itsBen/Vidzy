# Vidzy: A MEAN stack tutorial

## About

This project is simply a result of a tutorial followed to learn the basics of the MEAN stack. It involves utilizing MongoDB and Angular to create an API and web interface for adding, modifying, and deleting video titles from a virtual catalog.

The tutorial I followed can be found here: https://blog.udemy.com/node-js-tutorial/

Additional to that I followed the tutorial from the book [Getting MEAN](https://www.manning.com/books/getting-mean-with-mongo-express-angular-and-node) in order to implement a basic authentication.
